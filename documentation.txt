    The style-sheet begins with a comment that displays the color pallet used for styling the page, which was obtained using the color pallet generator at coolers.com. I chose this color pallet because I felt that it was cool and calming, which goes along with the website's theme of being made for unwinding and overall wellness. The style-sheet continues with a large section for everything that I consider to be a "global" style, which pertain to the elements that appear on all pages of the website.
